##React Components

The application is made of following commponents:
1) Header
2) Footer
3) Buttons
4) DataTable --> 
      1) TableHead
      2) RowTable

#Styling components
I used bootstrap for styling the components. Makes life easy!

#Hooks
useState and useEffect are the most common hooks used here. If the applicaion was to be made with more features, redux and contextAPI would be appropriate. As for now, Redux and contextAPI are too OP! 2-levels of Prop-drilling has been done which shouldn't affect the performance of the application and the code is quite readable.

#States
States & Data are being passed to children via parents thru' props. In addition, data & state are being passed from children to parent via callbacks.

##Functional/Non-functional Requirements

● How familiar you are with APIs
To get around "Daily api call limits reached" I used VPN to changed the IP lol. useEffect has been used to load all the data on inital screen load. This data is only displayed on clicking 'Load' button.

● Basic React knowledge
The project clearly demonstrates my concepts. However, I do not occupy myself remembering all the syntaxes and structures. I use Google, StackOverflow, W3Schools, MDN, Yotutube and other awesome community of developers All The Time!

● How state is handled
State is handled inside various functions. 

● Array/object operations
Props are dynamically passed to children with operations on json, array/objects thru' functions like map, foreach, etc

● Coding standards and naming conventions
Coding Standards have been followed altho' this is much inclined to the preference of the developer or policy of a company. However, codes is understandable.

● Structuring of the project
All the components have been organized into the 'Components' folder

● Git commits
Finished the project in 1 sitting and 2 commits.
